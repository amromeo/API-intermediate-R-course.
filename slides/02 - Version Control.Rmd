## Why use version control?

![One of many justifications for using version control. Source: phdcomics.com](../assets/phd_comic_final_version.jpg)

## Git principles

- Git works by taking snapshots of a set of files over time
- Most operations are performed on your local machine
- Every change is captured
- Git generally adds data and does not remove it (which means it is hard to lose data)

## Git workflow

## Git setup

If you have not set up Git per the pre-course instructions (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and signed up for an account on Github.com (https://github.com/join), you will need to do so before you can complete the next exercise.

## Exercise 1

Walk through a local Git workflow to commit a file in your msacl-201-project

## Exercise 1 Comments

- Local Git workflow addresses versioning issues
  - You decide when to stage and commit a version
  - Commit messages can help trace your work
- Provides ability to roll back to a previous version (not covered but quick access through History button)

## Distributed workflows: central management

## Exercise 2

Fork course repository and open as new project in RStudio

## Exercise 3

Push your changes to your remote repository

## Exericise 2 & 3 comments

- Github (or other hosted Git solution) allows a remote repository to be synced and worked on at multiple locations/computers
- More importantly, a remote repository provides a mechanism for collaboration

## Optional exercise

Open a pull request and have your edits come back into the base repository

## Additional Git wisdom

- Use branches and couple to features/issues
- Set up ssh to transfer data
- Consider what should and shouldn't go into version control
