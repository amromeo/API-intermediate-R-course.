## Use a version control system

![One of many justifications for using version control. Source: phdcomics.com](assets/phd_comic_final_version.jpg)

The concept of capturing changes to a document by resaving the file with different names is well-intentioned and lines up with previous concepts of reproducibilty. This can help capture changes you've made in the evolution of a project. The problem with this method is that it is very clunky and, realistically, you will not be able to capture every single change you've made. When writing code, you often do want to capture changes at a higher resolution than when writing a paper or other text document. 

The basic functionality of a version control system tracks changes (in addition to who made changes in collaborative settings) and makes it easier to undo changes. But you can go further with version control and implement it as a tool in collaboration workflows because it enables multiple people to work on changes to the same set of files at once.

### A brief intro to Git

This section is a high level summary of many concepts explained in Chapter 1 of the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) textbook. There are other great resources to learn about using Git and using Git with RStudio, including http://happygitwithr.com, https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN, and http://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/.

Git was originally developed as a tool to support the development of Linux (the open source operating system that powers most web servers and many mobile devices). There were a variety of requirements but to meet the needs of a large open source project, the version control system needed to support many contributors working in parallel in a sizable code base.

Git works on the following principles:

- Git works by taking snapshots of a set of files over time
- Most operations are performed on your local machine
- Every change is captured
- Git generally adds data and does not remove it (which means it is hard to lose data)

When working in Git, there are three states that files live in: modified, staged, and committed. A modified file is self explanatory - you have made some change to a file in your project. When the file is staged, you indicate that that modified file will be incorporated into your next snapshot. When the file (or files) is/are committed, you then indicate that the staged file(s) can now be stored. Committing is indicating to Git that you are ready to take the snapshot. This workflow is captured visually below.

### Hands-on with Git

First we need to learn how to interact with Git locally. We can do this easily within a RStudio project.

*If you have not set up Git per the pre-course instructions (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and signed up for an account on Github.com (https://github.com/join), you will need to do so before you can complete the next exercise.*

**Exercise 1**

If you have not previously set up Git and the interface within RStudio on your system, first follow these steps:

1. First we need to set up our git configuration to include our email address and user name. Open either Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) and run the following:
  1. git config --global user.name "*your username*"
  1. git config --global user.email *your email address*
1. Before we can use the Git interface in RStudio, we need to enable version control in the application. Navigate to "Global Options" under the Tools menu with RStudio and select "Git/SVN" on the lefthand menu. Ensure that the check box for "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects" is checked.

Next we will take our sample project and enable Git within the project to demonstrate the workflow.

1. Navigate to your msacl-201-project RStudio window (refer to upper right hand corner to see project name)
1. Note the tabs you see on the upper right quadrant. You should see tabs for Environment, History, and Connections (depending on version of RStudio and any personal window customizations)
1. Navigate to the Tools menu in your menubar and select "Version Control", then "Project Setup..."
1. In the Project Options window that pops up, navigate to the "Git/SVN" menu (if not already there).
1. Select "Git" in the "Version control system" options.
1. A prompt for "Confirm New Git Repository" should pop up. Select "Yes".
1. A "Confirm Restart RStudio" prompt will pop up. Select "Yes".

Capturing changes using the Git window:

1. Create a new R file (one quick way: click shortcut button on top left of window above console and select "R Script").
1. Add a few comment lines (recall that comments are denoted by #) with any content you'd like (e.g. title, author, date).
1. Save the file (can use disk button) to the src folder and give it a name (e.g. sample).
1. Now navigate to the Git window on the top right.
1. There is a list of files and directories (that include files) within the project directory. Click the checkbox under "Staged" for the "src/" folder. The status column changed to include a green A icon. This indicates you are adding the file to the version control system.
1. Hit the "Commit" button (menu options within Git window).
1. A new "RStudio: Review Changes" window will pop up. Highlight the "src/sample.R" file (or whatever you named it) that you added. You will see your code highlighted in green to indicate additions to the code.
1. Type "My first commit" (or anything else you'd like) in the Commit message window on the top right, and hit the "Commit" button under it. A Git commit window will pop up showing some details of the commit you made. Close that window and close the Review Changes window.
1. Go back to your R script and delete at least one line and add another, then save.
1. Navigate back to the Git window, and repeat the steps of checking the box to stage, hitting the Commit button (note the red and green highlights in the Review Changes), writing a commit message, and commiting.

Congratulations! You have learned to stage and commit changes in your local Git repository.

**End Exercise**

### Moving to distributed workflows

So far everything we have done has been on a local repository. A powerful aspect of Git is the ability to maintain a centralized repository outside of your local machine. This can help you synchronize the repo (short for repository) between multiple computers, but more importantly, this facilitates workflows in which multiple people contribute to a project. Imagine our local Git repository has a copy that lives on another system but is publically available for yourself and others to access. That is the function of GitHub, which hosts our course repo.

GitHub is the largest host of Git repositories and hosts open source projects (like this course) for free. GitHub also hosts private repos for a fee, and there are other services such as GitLab and BitBucket that host Git repos but also provide other functionality. GitHub is very popular among academic software projects because most are open source (and therefore free to host) but there is one important factor to consider when using the free GitHub service: content is hosted on their servers so this may not be a good fit for sensitive data (such as health information). Many organizations who write code to analyze sensitive information do not risk committing this information and purchase Git services that allow them to host repositories on their own hardware. *Always be very careful about preventing sensitive information from being available publically when working with version control system (and in general).*

One possible workflow when taking advantage of a distributed Git repository, which we refer to as a "remote" repository, is one which multiple people work from one repo and are continually bringing over copies to their local machines and then committing changes.

![Centralized workflow with Git. Credit: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows](assets/centralized_workflow.png)

A common workflow in GitHub is one in which there is a single official project repo that contributors create a public clone of, make changes to their own repo, and request that the official repo incorporate changes into the main project ("pull request"). A step-by-step breakdown of the process illustrated below is as follows:

1. The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.
1. A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.
1. The contributor pushes to their own public copy.
1. The contributor sends the maintainer a "pull request" asking them to pull changes.
1. The maintainer adds the contributorâ€™s repository as a remote and merges locally.
1. The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.

We have placed the contents of this course into a shared Git repository (central hub) for the class to download and work with. This will help cut down on the scripting you need to run through the exercises for this course and will also give you the chance to work with Git. In the following exercise you will use Git with the existing course repository to move through the typical workflow using RStudio.

**Exercise 2**

Forking the course repository:

1. Navigate to the course repository at https://github.com/pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course.
1. Select the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. If you are not already signed in, you will be asked to sign in.
1. You should now have the course repository under your account at Github (github.com/*your-user-name*/MSACL-intermediate-R-course). 

We will explain why we "forked" the repository in more detail after the exercise.

Opening the repository as a project in RStudio:

1. Under the File menu within the RStudio application, select "New Project".
1. Select "Version Control" in the first Create Project prompt.
1. Select "Git" in the next Create Project from Version Control prompt.
1. Copy and paste the URL for the repository you just forked (github.com/*your-user-name*/MSACL-intermediate-R-course) into the prompt for Repository URL.
1. Select a project name as well as a destination folder for your project (perhaps under a newly created Projects folder?).

Creating a file and using the Git workflow:

1. Let's create a new file within the repository by navigating to "New File" under the File menu and selecting "R Script".
1. Add a title to the first line by inserting a comment (using #) with a title: "# My Commit".
1. Add another comment line: "# Author: *your-user-name*".
1. Add a single line of code, eg. `print("Hello world")`.
1. Save the file in the your repository folder with the following convention:  username_commit.R.
1. If not already open, open up the Git window in the top left of the RStudio window (click the Git tab). You should see your new file in that window with two boxes containing yellow question marks. Check the box for the file under Staged and you should see a green box with an "A" under the Status box. This has taken a new file (with a modified status) and staged it.
1. Stage and commit the file per the steps outlined in the previous exercise. Add "My commit" to the Commit message window and hit the "Commit" button below.

That is the general workflow you will use within RStudio. Modify (or add) a file, stage it by checking the box in the Git window, and then commit it. Be sure to include helpful comments when you commit, in case you need to go back to a previous version. All of these changes have happened locally on your machine.

**End Exercise**

When we first pulled the course repository, we completed the first few steps of this workflow. We took the central version of the course repo and made a local copy on our Github accounts ("forked" the repository). Then we started making local changes and committing them. Now we can work through updating the remote repository.

**Exercise 3**

*These steps are dependent on completing the previous exercise*

1. Now that you have committed changes to your local repository, you can update your remote repository on GitHub by "pushing" the local changes to the remote repository. Press the "Push" button (with a green up arrow beside it) to push your changes to remote.
1. You should be prompted for a username and password. Enter your GitHub username and password and you should seen an indication that the push has completed.
1. Navigate to your MSACL-intermediate-R-course repository on your web browser (github.com/*your-user-name*/MSACL-intermediate-R-course). You should see the file you've added there.

Now both of your local repo and your remote repo are aligned.

**End Exercise**

In software projects that have multiple contributors, you need a workflow that allows contributors to work on different pieces of code and contribute changes in a structured fashion, ideally so a single owner of the repository can review and incorporate changes. The common way this is done with open source projects on GitHub is the pull request workflow: a contributor forks a repository, makes some changes in their repo, and then sends a pull request to the original contributor

**Optional Exercise** 

If you would like to try the pull request workflow

1. Navigate to your MSACL repository webpage (under your username in GitHub) and select the "New pull request" button near the top.
1. Under "Compare changes", select the link to "compare across forks".
1. Click the "base fork" button and select "pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course". Click the "base" button adjacent to the "base fork" button and select "class-contributions".
1. Click the "head fork" button and select your repository, if not already selected.
1. The "Create pull request" button should be available to select now. Click the button and add any comments to close out the pull request process.

On our end, we will get a notification about a pull request and can choose to incorporate the code into the repository.

**End Exercise**

You can keep your repository synchronized with the original by following steps below.

If you would like to synchronize your MSACL repo with the main course repo in the future

1. Open Terminal within RStudio on the bottom left of the window (tab is adjacent to Console tab).
1. The Terminal window should be set to your MSACL course repo directory. Run `ls` to confirm that you see the course contents. If not, use `cd` to navigate to the right directory.
1. Enter `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course`.
1. Enter `git remote -v` to list the remote repositories. You should see the main course repository listed as upstream. 

Now your course repository is linked to the main course repo.

In the future, if you want to retrieve changes to the original course repo:
1. With your working directory set to the project directory, enter `git fetch upstream` (in Terminal console or Git Bash). This pulls any changes from the upstream repo to your local system.
1. Enter `git checkout master` to make sure you are on your master branch (explained more below).
1. Enter `git merge upstream/master` to merge the course repo changes with your local repository.

These instructions were adapted from the following: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork.

The Git workflow for keeping changes updated is not as seamless as many modern document editors such as Office 365 or Google Docs, which continuously update changes for you without manual saving. One reason Git does not work that way is that your commits are expected to be strategic and coupled with changes that you may want to roll back. This is important to give you confidence that you do not need to create backup copies of your work, but the trade off is that you have to do extra work to make sure updates are captured. This is especially important when working with a remote repository. We made local changes and pushed those to the remote to update it. But imagine another scenario where you are working on multiple computers and made changes on computer A yesterday but are working on computer B today. If you pushed your changes from computer A to the remote yesterday, you can perform the opposite function on computer B today. You would use the "Pull" button to pull the contents of the remote repository onto your local computer B.

### Addditional Git tips and tricks

#### Using branches

When multiple people are working on a repository or you are working on multiple types of changes in a repository, there are other potential workflows besides forking a repository, making changes, and sending a pull request. A branch in Git is essentially another line of development that allows you to work without disrupting the primary line of code development (most often the *master* branch). RStudio provides support to create new branches and change branches - both features are on the top right of the Git window.

![Branching in Git. Credit: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge](assets/branching.png)

So when should you use branches? Arguably the cleanest way to use branches is to couple each branch to a major feature or change in your code. This is particularly helpful if you (and your team) want to work on multiple features at once. You can isolate each feature to branch, test it, and merge the branch (this can be done via similar workflows to the pull request) but also allows parallel development. To take this workflow one step further, GitHub and other Git-based systems allow you to open up "issues" (note the "Issues" tab on a GitHub repo page) that can include feature requests. You can open up a branch, name it for an issue, work on the feature, and then close out the issue when the feature is completed and tested.

#### Setting up ssh

Typing in your password every time you interact with remote repository (eg. in GitHub) can be annoying to do repeatedly. An alternative is to set up SSH. At a high level, this requires setting up a public-private SSH key pair, where the private key lives on your machine (and should not be shared!) and the public key lives in your GitHub profile. There are nice instructions for setting this up from either RStudio or the shell (eg. Terminal tab) at http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html. 

SSH is a useful protocol to know about in general. There is a short tutorial at https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work that explains many of the concepts. For a general reading resource on cryptography, [The Code Book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IK8PLE/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) by Simon Singh is highly recommended.

#### What should and shouldn't go into version control

The last thing to consider is a question: should you put everything in your project under version control? Maybe not. Git and similar version control systems typically do not handle raw data files well and the repository site you use may impose file size limits (Github has a 100 MB limit). *Also note that your repository site may be public so storing sensitive data (such as health information) within the repo may be problematic.* The excellent article by [Wilson et al.](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) covers these issues in more details and provides nice guidance about what should not go into version control. Practically, the .gitignore can help exclude specific files - it is simply a list of files or groups of files to ignore. As an example, including "*.html" in the .gitignore will exclude html pages from your repository. (The reason for doing this will become more obvious in the next lesson.)

#### Additional Git resources

Finally, there are variety of resources available to learn Git.
- The [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com) online book walks through Git in a lot more detail, with a lot more explanation.
- The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) textbook has a lot of detail about a variety of Git topics outside of the context of R and RStudio. 
- There is also a downloadable Git tutorial that may be helpful to reinforce many of the above concepts: https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron.

## Summary

- Version control helps to track changes to code as you update it, and enables you to jump back to a previous working version of your code if there is a breaking change (as an example)
- The process of staging a file, or indicating it is ready for changes, and commiting files, or explicitly capturing changes, happens locally on the file system your working files are in
- Repositories can be hosted remotely (e.g. on Github) and synced with code on your local filesystem through pulls from the remote to your local machine and pushes from your machine to the remote repository
- Efficient collaboration workflows have evolved using remote repositories and pull requests that allow distributed coders to make changes to local copies of a repostory and request those changes be incorporated into the main repository
